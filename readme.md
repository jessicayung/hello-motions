# Hello Motions

Hello Motions is an online debating motions (debating topics) database. Users can search for debating motions by words in the motion, tournament name, motion category (politics, economics, international relations) or Chief Adjudicator (the people who set the motion).

- Motions from 2016 June onwards or any motions not from the European circuit or WUDC are particularly welcome. 
- You **do not** need to check that the motions are not yet included on the site, though that always helps.
